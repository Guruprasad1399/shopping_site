        <p>Sanspareils Greenlands, commonly known by the abbreviation SG, is an Indian cricket equipment manufacturer.
            Its balls are used in Test cricket and in the Ranji Trophy in India.They have a more prominent seam and are
            closer together than the Kookaburra balls used for Test matches, used in rest of the world apart from
            England and West Indies (which use Dukes), resulting from the thicker thread used for stitching. The balls
            are also completely hand-crafted.</p>
        <p>Brothers Kedarnath and Dwarakanath Anand established Sanspareils Co. in Sialkot in 1931. They were originally
            from Lahore where they apprenticed in their uncle's sports shop RICHIE Sports. In 1940 they established a
            company named Greenlands to facilitate export of their products. After the partition of India, the family
            moved to Agra and then settled in Meerut in 1950. Its factory has been in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh since 1950.
        </p>

        <p>SG has been exporting bats manufactured in Meerut to the UK and Australia for most of the international
            cricket brands. The company has been the market leader in India with legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Mohammad
            Azharuddin and Rahul Dravid endorsing the brand.
